## Hi, I'm Max

Solving problems with code is my passion.

### What I'm working on

Currently, I am trying to cleanup my favorite personal repos. Right now, I'm working on bringing `contactor` to life and hopefully adding a demo to my website [mnewco.dev](https://mnewco.dev) soon!

I'm also testing my skills and trying to templatize a k8s cluster in Hetzner for the basis of all my future project demos :)

### Extra details

I was a little stupid early in my career and didn't follow the github best practices of one account for personal and work. I transferred as much as I could, but unfortunately a lot of my work commits are on a no-reply email address (making it impossible to associate to my personal account). So, if you have doubts of my work history feel free to reference my work account timeline here [max-denari](https://github.com/max-denari)
